# Python Webscraping and Stock Price Prediction Project
 
 
 ### Description
 The project utilizes modules such as MatPlotLib, numpy, and pandas to pull data from the internet (source: yahoo finance) to create a projection of stock price for a given stock. For this project's tests, Tesla (TSLA) was used, but any company within the SNP500 is viable for data projection. Disclaimer: The stock pricing for future years may not be perfectly accurate, as the model only offers a projection. The program pulls tickers from the SNP500 and is able to create a graphical model depicting financial data for the ticker from a given start date to a given end date.
 
 ### Goal
  To create a projection for popular stocks so that users can make decisions on what shares to purchase.
